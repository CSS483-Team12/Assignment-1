Team Assignment 1, CSS 483

Griffin Ryan, Tony Le

No shortcomings. The worm works perfectly and creates up to 5 copies of itself to compile and execute.

The number of replications is hardcoded in the beginning of the main(), and can be changed from 5.

Included in the src/ directory is the captured output. A directory called `src/dir5` is created to place `src/dir5/Worm5.java`, and dynamically handles the other replications in a similar manner. These are included in this submission as the necessary output captures.

To see it in action, remove any src/dir*/ files and use src/Worm.java to generate the worm processes.
